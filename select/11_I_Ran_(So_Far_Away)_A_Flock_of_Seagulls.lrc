[01:33.59] I walked along the avenue
[01:37.19] I never thought I'd meet a girl like you
[01:41.41] Meet a girl like you
[01:47.09] With auburn hair and tawny eyes
[01:50.26] The kind of eyes that hypnotize me through
[01:54.54] Hypnotize me through
[02:04.54] 
[01:58.40] And I ran, I ran so far away
[02:04.90] I just ran, I ran all night and day
[02:11.24] I couldn't get away
[02:20.74] 
[02:26.21] A cloud appears above your head
[02:29.27] A beam of light comes shining down on you
[02:33.89] Shining down on you
[02:39.28] The cloud is moving nearer still
[02:42.60] Aurora borealis comes in view
[02:47.14] Aurora comes in view
[02:57.14] 
[02:51.41] And I ran, I ran so far away
[02:57.81] I just ran, I ran all night and day
[03:04.59] I couldn't get away
[03:14.09] 
[03:39.42] Reached out a hand to touch your face
[03:42.13] You're slowly disappearing from my view
[03:46.90] 'Pearing from my view
[03:52.03] Reached out a hand to try again
[03:55.76] I'm floating in a beam of light with you
[04:00.31] A beam of light with you
[04:12.31] 
[04:04.02] And I ran, I ran so far away
[04:10.52] I just ran, I ran all night and day
[04:17.26] And I ran, I ran so far away
[04:23.93] I just ran, I couldn't get away
