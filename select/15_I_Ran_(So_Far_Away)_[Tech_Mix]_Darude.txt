I walked along the avenue, I never thought I'd meet a girl like you
Meet a girl like you.
With auburn hair and tawny eyes, the kind of eyes that hypnotize me through
Hypnotize me through.

And I ran
I just ran

And I ran, I ran so far away
I just ran, I ran all night and day

And I ran
I couldn't get away

I couldn't get away
I couldn't get away
I couldn't get away
I couldn't get away
I couldn't get away
I couldn't get away
I couldn't get away
I couldn't get away

'Appearing from my view.
Reached out a hand to try again. I'm floating in a beam of light with you
A beam of light with you.

And I ran, I ran so far away
I just ran, I ran all night and day
Night and day, night and day...

And I ran...
