[00:46.04] Hey lady, you got the love I need
[00:58.01] Maybe more than enough
[01:02.05] Oh darling, darling, darling walk a while with me
[01:07.00] Oh, you've got so much
[01:13.08] So much
[01:16.06] So much
[01:19.56] 
[01:26.08] Many times I loved
[01:30.04] Many times been bitten
[01:32.08] Many times I've gazed
[01:35.02] Along the open road
[01:44.52] 
[01:47.05] Many times I've lied
[01:50.06] Many times I've listened
[01:52.01] Many times I've wondered
[01:54.05] How much there is to know
[02:06.55] 
[02:06.05] Many dreams come true
[02:09.03] And some have silver linings
[02:11.08] I live for my dream
[02:14.04] And a pocketful of gold
[02:25.54] 
[03:16.09] Mellow is the man
[03:18.02] Who knows what he's been missing
[03:21.04] Many many men
[03:23.08] Can't see the open road
[03:34.58] 
[03:34.05] Many is a word
[03:38.03] That only leaves you guessing
[03:40.03] Guessing 'bout a thing
[03:44.08] You really ought to know, ooh
[03:50.05] Really ought to know
[03:55.05] I really ought to know
[04:06.05] 
[03:59.07] Oooh, you know I should
[04:05.02] You know I should
[04:06.01] You know I should
