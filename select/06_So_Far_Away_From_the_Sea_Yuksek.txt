Stuck into a wave
Surfing on my pain
Storm will never end
And you're like a fish into my vein.
But I'll never forget
This isn't what we want
This isn't what I need.
Everyone says "yeah"
But they're not my friends
Everyday I see you
But I never forget
That soon I'll loose the faith.
Oh the night's so long,
AWAY FROM THE SEA!
In the creek I ran away from the sea
Wanna sleep but
OH THE NIGHT'S SO LONG!
